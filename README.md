## About

This project was not particulary difficult to build from a technical standpoint. I mainly built this to learn some new technologies (those being Next.js and Ant Design). I'm pretty happy with how it turned out!

- Project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Search is powered by the [HaveIBeenPwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) API
- The UI design was created using [Ant Design](https://ant.design), with animations powered by [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css)
